# UPI Transactions Data Analysis

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions data with interactive visualizations and detailed insights.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project consists of a Power BI report with multiple pages that analyze UPI transaction data across different dimensions including banks, cities, payment methods, and transaction types. The analysis includes various interactive visualizations and filters to help understand transaction patterns and trends.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Multiple slicers for detailed data filtering:
  - Bank Name (Sent & Received)
  - City
  - Device Type
  - Gender
  - Age Groups
  - Merchant Name
  - Payment Method
  - Purpose
  - Transaction Type

- **Visualizations**:
  - Transaction trends by month (Line & Column charts)
  - Balance analysis by month (Line & Column charts)
  - Currency-wise transaction analysis
  - City-wise transaction distribution

- **Bookmark Navigation**: Easy switching between different chart types:
  - Transactions by Month [Line]
  - Transactions by Month [Column]
  - Balance by Month [Line]
  - Balance by Month [Column]
